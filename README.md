# TicTacToe

<p align="justify">Just a little TicTacToe program I made when I was bored during a Zoom meeting.</p>

<p align="justify">The idea for this program was from a tutorial video on YouTube, but I had to introduce a few changes to the code since there were some bugs and logical errors. The human player 
plays crosses, and has to enter the number corresponding to the tile he wants to play in the console (from 1 to 9). The opponent doesn't have an AI and chooses random tiles for 
its next play. The game grid will be updated with the player's and opponent's plays and the program will check if all the current plays of either player correspond to a winning 
combination to determine if it should continue, declare a winner or declare a draw.</p>
