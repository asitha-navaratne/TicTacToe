# TicTacToe

<p align="justify">Just a little tic-tac-toe game I made when I was bored.</p>

<p align="justify">The idea for this program was from a tutorial video on YouTube, but I had to introduce a few changes to the code since there were some bugs and logical errors. The human player plays crosses, and has to enter the number corresponding to the tile he wants to play in the console (from 1 to 9). The opponent player (CPU) chooses random tiles for its next play. The game grid will be updated with the player's and opponent's plays and the program will check if all the current plays of either player correspond to any winning combination (stored within a list of lists) to determine if it should continue, declare a winner or declare a draw.</p>
